Title: Optimise Energy Flexibilities
Version: 1.0
Author: Hendrik Obel√∂er
Maintainer: <hendrik.obeloeer@haw-hamburg.de>
Description: The goal of flexoptr is to provide a suite of functions to 
    generalise and ease the modelling of energy flexibilities. By defining base
    parameters, the needs of a constrained flexibility are calculated, and
    optimised over price data. Several functions to facilitate the optimisation
    of more complex market and configuration analyses are also provided.
